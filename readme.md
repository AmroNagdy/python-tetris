# Motivation
This is my first personal project in Python. I wanted to build an app that would require me to learn a few key concepts in Python, mainly OOP and multi-threading. Before writing this app I had heard that these were two weak-points of the language when compared to Java, so I wanted to see what the limitations/difficulties of applying these concepts in Python were. Overall, it didn't seem as bad as people had claimed!

# How To Use
To have an optimal experience, I recommend running the app in a UNIX environment, since this project relies on the curses library.
Simply run the tetris.py script in the root folder; the controls are shown at start-up.
