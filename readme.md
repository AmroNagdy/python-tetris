# Why Tetris in Python?
This is my first personal project in Python. I wanted to build an app that would force me to learn a few key concepts in Python, mainly OOP and multi-threading. Before writing this app I had heard that these were two weak-points of the language when compared to Java, so I wanted to see what the limitations/difficulties of applying these concepts in Python were. Overall, it didn't seem as bad as people had claimed!

# How to Play
To have an optimal experience, I recommend running the app in a UNIX environment, since this project relies on the curses library.
All you need to do is run the tetris.py script in the root folder (with Python3!). The controls are shown at start-up.
